WebApi.Html5.Upload
===================

A prototype for uploading CSV files to an ASP.NET WebAPI site based off Filip W's original code and blog post (http://www.strathweb.com/2012/08/a-guide-to-asynchronous-file-uploads-in-asp-net-web-api-rtm/).
Uses Josh Closes' CsvHelper (https://github.com/JoshClose/CsvHelper).
